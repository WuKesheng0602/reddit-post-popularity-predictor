I was going for a catch and was running forward with my head turned around. I was about to catch the Frisbee when I collided with a metal bench. My shin made impact with the 'seat' part of the bench, and I somersaulted over the back of the bench. I landed face first onto the rubber track, did a scorpion, and finally came to rest. \n\nPart of the skin on my leg tore off and stuck to the bench. The students gathered around noted the hairs. I didn't bother looking at it. \n\nI ended up needing 16 stitches, but the part that hurt the worst was my face. I got major road rash on my cheek. I can provide pics of my leg in the doctor's office. The scar is still pretty slick.\n\nTL;DR: ran into a bench. Flesh removal, blood, and wild scorpions ensued.

At friday night at 9pm, I was at a birthday party in a village next to my town. It was a big party with 40+ people in the backyard, loud music and lots of drinks. I was having a good time. \n\n2-3 hours later I get a call from a friend (f), who is my crush. She lives in a city, but had come to my town and was out with our friends who weren't invited to the party. She asks me when am I going to leave and we decide to meet up when I do. By 12:30 am I wish happy birthday again and leave. \n\nWhen I arrive at my town, I meet my crush and we're alone. She tells me that she has no way of getting back and must wait untill morning to catch a bus and head home. We decide to go to an internet cafe to spend some time there. We stay there and browse facebook and talk. Around 2am we head out to a Rock Bar for a drink.  We stay there for some time talking and smoking, untill we're bored and decide to leave 2 or 3 hours later. We go to grab some food at a creperie, and then we hang out in different quiet places. by 6:30 am, we see the sun rise and start making fun of how retarted we are for being out so late. Anyway, by 8am she and I go on our different ways. She takes a bus for her city and I go home.\n\nWhen I arrive home, I see my dad sleeping at the couch. I felt relieved only to see my mother being awake and looking towards me with anger. My phone battery had died and they couldn't contact me, so they were worried(oh for fuck's shake I'm 17). She wakes my dad up and they start giving me a lecture about responsibility etc. While this happens, I am standing in front of them, thinking only about getting sleep. When they're done, I reply with a simple Good Night (even though it was morning by that time) and make my way to my room.\n\nI woke up at 5pm and learnt that I was grounded for at least a week, and that my parents are kinda angry with me, especially my dad. I didn't think any of this would happen, since it wasn't the first time I returned so late home, but this time annoyed them.\n\nWhatever, thanks for reading my long post!\n\nTL:DR, Left a birthday party I was, Spent the rest of the night with my crush not giving a fuck about if people will be worried about my absence from home, returned home in the morning and had a lecture from my parents, got grounded.", "id": "4je2wb"}, {"author": {"name": "Tako_Taco", "created_utc": 1422079563.0, "link_karma": 1, "comment_karma": 23, "is_gold": true, "id": "kww4w"}, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/4jdyo7/tifu_by_getting_an_eye_full_of_hot_sauce/", "title": "TIFU by getting an eye full of hot sauce", "created_utc": 1463273717.0, "selftext": "So, yesterday morning I took a girl from work on a date to this fancy little seaside breakfast shack for breakfast. As a side note she brought her baby along. We talked, had a good time, I ordered green tea pancakes and eggs, cus green tea is bombtastic, and the waitress brought our food over.\n\nThis is where the FU happened. So I'm one of those people who like ketchup on their eggs. This little breakfast shack had put their condiments in small little squirt bottles, and there were two of them that were red, but the container was opaque. Being the genius I am, I thought to myself I'd just open it and smell what's inside to find the ketchup. So I picked up a bottle with red liquid inside, opened it, and squeezed so I could get a wiff of what was contained inside. I guess there was some sauce stuck in the top so low and behold I received a face blast of hot sauce and mostly into my left eye.\n\nNow at this point I start freaking out because it feels like my eye ball is about to explode, then the baby starts freaking out, and my date is just laughing and calming her child down.

That being said, when I get to scrubbing them, they don't like it that much. There's pee a'flyin, poop a'poopin, and usually the job ends with a green toothbrush and *pissed* turtle. I always give the toothbrush a run under the sink afterwords, though!\nSo in my stupid carelessness I left the toothbrush on the sink, on the opposite side of my personal toothbrush. Fast-forward to tonight, and after a dinner party I was very tired, and feeling a little nostalgic. I shuffle into the bathroom, thinking of a poem I read, and absentmindedly begin brushing. \n\n*brush, brush, brush*\n\nSuddenly I realize that my toothbrush feels...different. And tastes odd, beyond the toothpaste. Looking down, I see that horrible pink color, and know *this is not my purple toothbrush*.

I went downstairs with my laptop while between games to the kitchen and in the fridge was a nice plastic cup of soup. Quickly made some toast and microwaved the soup. Put the toast on a plate and the soup in a bowl and started heading back upstairs. All fairly standard.\n\nThis is where the fuck up was. As I was walking upstairs, I had the laptop in my left hand, and the plate/bowl precariously balanced in my right hand. As I got to the top of the staircase I tripped. Not wanting to destroy my laptop, I forgot about the soup and prioritised getting my laptop in the air away from harm being crushed under me. In the process the soup spilled all over my wrist, causing me to scream out in pain, throw my laptop down as gently as I could, and rush back to the kitchen to throw my wrist under the cold tap.\n\nMy wrist was burned pretty badly and the carpet is a little bit ruined. My wrist is now a nice shade of dark red with one particularly bad blister just below the thumb.\n\nTl;dr: Made and spilled some late night soup. Burned my wrist, ruined my carpet and missed a game of Overwatch.", "id": "4jdv48"}]
